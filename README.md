# collaboration22

We learn how to collaborate on github with branches, issues and forks

## Tasks - in alphabetic order

1. Open the [students.txt](students.txt) file and add your name. Save the changes in a new branch with your name
2. The next student is doing the same to your branch, creating his own branch - until we have as many branches as students
3. File an issue on the branch of the student after you for the [text.txt](text.txt) and the spelling mistakes.
