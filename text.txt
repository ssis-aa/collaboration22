I started my schooling as the majority did in my area, at the local primary school. I then
went to the local secondary school and received grades in English, Maths, Physics,
Biology, Geography, Art, Graphical communication, and Philosophy of Religion. I'll not
bore you with the 'A' levels and above.
Notice the ambiguous English qualification above. It was, in truth, a course dedicated to
reading "Lord of the flies" and other gems and a weak attempt at getting us to
comprehend them. Luckily my middle-class upbringing gave me a head start as I was
already acquainted with that sort of language these books used (and not just the Peter and
Jane books) and had read similar books before. I will never be able to put that particular
course down as much as I desire to because, for all its faults, it introduced me to
Steinbeck, Malkovich and the wonders of Lenny, mice, and pockets.
My education never included one iota of grammar. Lynn Truss points out in "Eats,
shoots and leaves" that many people were excused from the rigors of learning English
grammar during their schooling over the last 30 or so years because the majority or
decision-makers decided one day that it might hinder imagination and expression (so
what, I ask, happened to all those expressive and imaginative people before the ruling?).
